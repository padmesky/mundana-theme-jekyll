Hi, my name is Havva.

I'm a software development engineer in test  working in LA.  My focus is  building test automation solutions and integrating them with CI/CD pipelines, also applying correct testing techniques and strategies to different types of products.  As much as I like to learn new tools, technologis and languages I also like to share my experience to spread the knowledge. 

I like travelling, disvovering new places in the city, tasting new cuisines, taking photos of the places that I visit. I like to discover new movies and tv series to watch.

I'm a member of the Toastmaster club in my company, as VP of education. I'm trying to improve my public speaking with taking a role in our each meeting that we have bi-weekly.

No matter how much I see the progress I made every day, I'm still growing and learning a lot. It's an endless journey.  So welcome to my crazy journey!
